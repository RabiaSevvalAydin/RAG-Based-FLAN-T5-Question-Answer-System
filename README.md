# RAG Based FLAN-T5 Q&A System

This project demonstrates a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach using FLAN-T5, initially developed for academic exploration in advanced LLM principles. It is designed to leverage the power of large language models with efficient retrieval techniques to provide accurate answers to user questions.

## Project Overview
* Architecture: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
* Retriever: FAISS 
* LLM Model: FLAN-T5-base
* Dataset: NaturalQuestions
* Evalutaion: EM (Exact Match), F1-score, ROUGE

ðŸš€ *Note:  This project is currently under development. The final codebase, including a fully functional RAG-enhanced QA system, will be available soon.*
